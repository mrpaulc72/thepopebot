# Logo & Brand Identity AI Architect: Full Process Architecture
## From Research to Functional Claude Project

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This document maps the complete process for building an AI-powered logo and 
brand identity system using Claude Projects. The system will take brand 
strategy inputs (ICA, company profile, positioning) and generate optimized 
prompts for AI image generation tools to produce professional-grade visual 
identity elements.

The process has five phases:
1. Research Architecture — Defining what to extract from the 11 studios
2. Deep Research Execution — Conducting and validating the research
3. Framework Synthesis — Converting research into implementable systems
4. Claude Project Construction — Building the actual project
5. Prompt Engineering Layer — Optimizing for AI image tool outputs

Estimated timeline: 3-5 weeks for full implementation (can be compressed 
with parallel execution).

================================================================================
PHASE 1: RESEARCH ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Before executing research, we must define precisely what information will 
be useful for the Claude Project's actual function: generating AI image 
prompts from brand strategy inputs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 THE EXTRACTION FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each of the 11 studios, research should extract five categories of 
information:

CATEGORY A: VISUAL SIGNATURE ANALYSIS
What makes each studio's work visually distinctive?

  Extract:
  - Dominant color philosophy (bold primaries, muted earth tones, etc.)
  - Typography preferences (custom lettering, geometric sans, serif, etc.)
  - Illustration style (flat vector, textured, 3D, character-driven, etc.)
  - Composition patterns (centered, asymmetric, contained shapes, etc.)
  - Texture and finish preferences (clean/flat vs. tactile/dimensional)
  
  Why this matters: These become "style parameters" the Claude Project can 
  apply when generating prompts. "Generate in the style of Garage Design 
  Studio" becomes a defined set of visual attributes.

CATEGORY B: STRATEGIC TRANSLATION PATTERNS
How does each studio translate brand strategy into visual choices?

  Extract:
  - How do they visualize "premium" vs. "accessible"?
  - How do they visualize "innovative" vs. "trustworthy"?
  - How do they handle category conventions (follow vs. break)?
  - What visual devices do they use for different brand personalities?
  
  Why this matters: This is the core logic layer. When a user inputs "we 
  want to feel premium but approachable," the system needs translation 
  rules to convert that into specific visual directions.

CATEGORY C: CPG/PACKAGING-SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY
Since most of these studios focus on CPG, what packaging-specific 
considerations do they employ?

  Extract:
  - Shelf visibility strategies (how logos work at distance)
  - Scalability considerations (logo on truck vs. on app icon)
  - Print production awareness (spot colors, finishes, substrates)
  - Hierarchy systems for product lines and variants
  
  Why this matters: CPG logos have constraints that tech logos don't. The 
  system needs to account for these when generating prompts.

CATEGORY D: PROCESS ARTIFACTS
What intermediate deliverables and frameworks do they use?

  Extract:
  - Mood board construction approaches
  - Concept presentation formats
  - Iteration and refinement workflows
  - Client feedback integration methods
  
  Why this matters: These become workflow templates the Claude Project can 
  guide users through.

CATEGORY E: PORTFOLIO REVERSE-ENGINEERING
For 3-5 specific projects per studio (where documented), analyze:

  Extract:
  - The apparent brief (what problem was being solved)
  - Visual choices made and their likely rationale
  - How the logo functions across applications
  - What makes it effective (or not)
  
  Why this matters: Concrete examples train the system's pattern matching 
  better than abstract principles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 RESEARCH CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO DESIGN STUDIOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike Lexicon (which has published methodology), design studios rarely 
document their process. Their portfolios show WHAT they made, not HOW or 
WHY. This requires a different research approach:

CHALLENGE 1: Methodology is implicit, not explicit
  
  Solution: Reverse-engineer from outputs. Analyze portfolios for patterns, 
  then infer the underlying decision logic. Flag all inferences clearly.

CHALLENGE 2: Visual work requires visual analysis

  Solution: The research prompt should direct the AI to examine actual 
  portfolio images (via web fetch of portfolio pages) and describe visual 
  attributes systematically.

CHALLENGE 3: Pricing and process details are rarely public

  Solution: Use the attached document's pricing estimates as baseline. For 
  process, look for case study write-ups, blog posts, and founder interviews 
  rather than expecting formal methodology documentation.

CHALLENGE 4: "Style" is subjective and hard to systematize

  Solution: Develop a standardized visual vocabulary (see Phase 3) that 
  allows consistent description across all 11 studios. This vocabulary 
  becomes the prompt engineering foundation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 STUDIO-SPECIFIC RESEARCH PRIORITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the attached overview, here's where to focus for each studio:

| Studio | Primary Research Focus | Secondary Focus |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Garage Design Studio | Illustration/character methodology; subscription model workflow | CPG packaging applications |
| Buttermilk Creative | CPG/grocery-specific constraints; "playful but polished" balance | FDA/compliance integration |
| Gander | Strategy-to-visual translation; "art + commerce" positioning | Typography systems |
| Eye Candy Design | Bold color and texture approaches; nostalgic-fresh tension | Tactile finish specification |
| Evyo Studio | Minimal cohesive systems; color-typography relationships | Cross-platform consistency |
| Designity | Creative Director model; systematic branding at scale | Subscription creative workflow |
| Duck.Design | Trend-aware consumer behavior integration; iteration approach | Subscription pricing structure |
| Happyland Creative | Startup-focused efficiency; brand audit methodology | Modernization/refresh approach |
| Honor Creative | Story-driven discovery process; narrative-to-visual translation | Future-focused brand positioning |
| Hardy Brands | Technical soundness emphasis; customer touchpoint mapping | Reputation-building through design |
| SmashBrand | Consumer testing integration; performance measurement | Research-design integration |

================================================================================
PHASE 2: DEEP RESEARCH EXECUTION
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 RESEARCH PROMPT STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deep research prompt should be structured as follows:

SECTION 1: INDIVIDUAL STUDIO PROFILES (11 sections)
  For each studio, systematically extract Categories A-E above.
  
SECTION 2: CROSS-STUDIO PATTERN ANALYSIS
  Identify commonalities and differentiators across all 11 studios.
  What do the best CPG-focused studios all do? Where do they diverge?
  
SECTION 3: VISUAL VOCABULARY EXTRACTION
  Compile the terminology and descriptive language used across studios 
  into a standardized lexicon for describing visual attributes.
  
SECTION 4: STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK SYNTHESIS
  Identify the decision frameworks that appear (explicitly or implicitly) 
  across multiple studios.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS FOR VISUAL RESEARCH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual methodology research has different verification requirements than 
text-based research:

VERIFIED (OBSERVED):
  Visual attributes directly observable in portfolio images.
  Example: "Garage Design Studio frequently uses custom hand-lettered 
  wordmarks with illustrated character elements" — this can be confirmed 
  by viewing their portfolio.

VERIFIED (STATED):
  Process or philosophy explicitly stated by the studio in published 
  materials.
  Example: "SmashBrand uses consumer testing at each stage" — stated on 
  their website.

INFERRED (PATTERN):
  Conclusions drawn from analyzing multiple examples.
  Example: "Buttermilk Creative appears to favor warm, saturated color 
  palettes for food brands" — inferred from portfolio patterns.

INFERRED (INDUSTRY STANDARD):
  Common practices assumed to apply based on industry norms.
  Example: "Logo files are likely delivered in vector formats" — standard 
  practice.

UNVERIFIABLE:
  Specific internal processes, pricing details, or methodologies not 
  publicly documented.
  Example: "Their exact creative briefing template" — not public.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 EXPECTED RESEARCH OUTPUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deep research phase should produce:

OUTPUT 1: Studio Profile Documents (11 documents)
  Structured profiles for each studio following the Category A-E framework.
  Approximately 1,500-2,500 words each.

OUTPUT 2: Visual Attribute Taxonomy
  A comprehensive vocabulary for describing logo and brand identity 
  visual characteristics, organized by category:
  - Color (palette types, relationships, psychological associations)
  - Typography (classifications, personality mappings, technical terms)
  - Composition (layout patterns, spatial relationships, hierarchy)
  - Illustration (style categories, technique descriptors)
  - Texture/Finish (surface treatments, dimensional effects)

OUTPUT 3: Strategic Translation Matrix
  A framework mapping brand strategy inputs to visual outputs:
  - Brand personality → Visual expression
  - Target audience → Style appropriateness
  - Category positioning → Convention navigation
  - Price point signaling → Visual premium indicators

OUTPUT 4: Process Workflow Synthesis
  A composite workflow drawing from observed studio practices:
  - Discovery/briefing phase
  - Concept development phase
  - Refinement/iteration phase
  - Delivery/handoff phase

OUTPUT 5: Case Study Library
  Detailed analysis of 20-30 specific logo/identity projects across 
  the 11 studios, following the reverse-engineering framework.

================================================================================
PHASE 3: FRAMEWORK SYNTHESIS
================================================================================

Research outputs are raw materials. This phase converts them into 
implementable system components.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 THE VISUAL STYLE ENGINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: Enable the Claude Project to translate abstract brand attributes 
into specific visual parameters.

COMPONENT 3.1.1: Brand Personality → Visual Attribute Mapping

  Create a matrix that maps personality descriptors to visual choices:
  
  | Brand Personality | Color Direction | Typography Direction | Illustration Direction |
  |-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
  | Playful | Saturated, varied palette | Rounded, bouncy, custom | Character-driven, animated feel |
  | Premium | Restrained, sophisticated | Refined serif or elegant sans | Minimal or none; photography focus |
  | Trustworthy | Blues, stable neutrals | Clean sans-serif, balanced | Simple iconography, no characters |
  | Innovative | Unexpected combinations | Modern geometric or custom | Abstract, dynamic forms |
  | [etc.] | | | |
  
  This matrix should have 15-20 personality dimensions with corresponding 
  visual recommendations derived from the studio research.

COMPONENT 3.1.2: Category Convention Database

  For major CPG categories (beverages, snacks, health foods, beauty, 
  household, etc.), document:
  
  - Visual conventions (what most brands in category do)
  - Differentiation opportunities (where conventions can be broken)
  - Mandatory elements (regulatory, functional requirements)
  - Shelf context considerations
  
  This enables strategic advice on whether to follow or subvert category norms.

COMPONENT 3.1.3: Style Reference Library

  For each of the 11 studios, create a "style card" that can be invoked:
  
  GARAGE DESIGN STUDIO STYLE:
  - Illustration-forward with custom character mascots
  - Hand-lettered or heavily customized wordmarks
  - Bold, confident color with playful sensibility
  - Elevated but approachable; artful without pretension
  - Strong CPG packaging presence
  
  When a user says "I like the Garage Design Studio aesthetic," the 
  system can apply these parameters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 THE PROMPT TRANSLATION LAYER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the critical bridge between design thinking and AI image generation.

COMPONENT 3.2.1: Visual Vocabulary → Prompt Language Dictionary

  AI image tools have specific languages that produce better results. 
  This component maps design terminology to effective prompt language:
  
  | Design Concept | Midjourney Prompt Language | DALL-E Prompt Language |
  |----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
  | Clean minimal logo | "minimal vector logo, clean lines, simple geometry, white background" | "minimalist logo design, geometric, vector style, professional" |
  | Playful character mascot | "cute mascot character, friendly expression, bold outlines, flat vector illustration" | "cartoon mascot logo, friendly character, colorful, flat design" |
  | Premium luxury wordmark | "elegant typography logo, refined letterforms, sophisticated, high-end branding" | "luxury brand logo, elegant serif typography, minimal, premium feel" |
  
  This dictionary should cover 50+ common design directions with 
  tool-specific prompt translations.

COMPONENT 3.2.2: Prompt Architecture Templates

  Structured templates for different logo/identity request types:
  
  WORDMARK PROMPT TEMPLATE:
  [Style modifier] typography logo for [company type], featuring the word 
  "[company name]" in [typography style], with [color direction], 
  [additional modifiers], [quality/format modifiers]
  
  LOGOMARK PROMPT TEMPLATE:
  [Style modifier] logo symbol for [company type], depicting [concept/metaphor], 
  in [illustration style], with [color direction], [additional modifiers], 
  [quality/format modifiers]
  
  COMBINATION MARK TEMPLATE:
  [Style modifier] logo design combining [symbol description] with 
  [typography style] text reading "[company name]", [composition direction], 
  [color direction], [quality/format modifiers]

COMPONENT 3.2.3: Quality and Format Modifiers

  Compile the technical modifiers that improve AI image output quality:
  
  General quality: "professional logo design," "vector style," "clean 
  background," "high quality," "award-winning design"
  
  Style consistency: "flat design," "minimal," "detailed illustration," 
  "hand-drawn style," "geometric"
  
  Format specifications: "on white background," "isolated," "centered 
  composition," "suitable for branding"
  
  Negative prompts: "no gradients," "no photorealistic," "no text errors," 
  "no busy backgrounds"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 THE STRATEGIC INTAKE FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Claude Project needs structured inputs to work effectively.

COMPONENT 3.3.1: Ideal Customer Avatar (ICA) Template

  Standardized format for capturing target audience:
  
  DEMOGRAPHICS:
  - Age range:
  - Gender skew (if any):
  - Income/socioeconomic:
  - Geographic:
  
  PSYCHOGRAPHICS:
  - Values and beliefs:
  - Lifestyle characteristics:
  - Aspirations:
  - Pain points:
  
  BEHAVIORAL:
  - Where they shop:
  - Media consumption:
  - Brand affinities (brands they love):
  - Purchase decision factors:
  
  VISUAL PREFERENCES:
  - Aesthetic sensibilities:
  - Design styles they respond to:
  - Colors/imagery that resonate:

COMPONENT 3.3.2: Company/Brand Profile Template

  Standardized format for capturing brand attributes:
  
  FUNDAMENTALS:
  - Company/product name:
  - Category:
  - Price positioning:
  - Key differentiator:
  
  BRAND PERSONALITY:
  - 3-5 personality adjectives:
  - Brand voice characteristics:
  - Brands to emulate (aspirational):
  - Brands to avoid (anti-references):
  
  COMPETITIVE CONTEXT:
  - Primary competitors:
  - Category visual conventions:
  - Differentiation strategy:
  
  PRACTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Primary applications (packaging, digital, signage, etc.):
  - Scale requirements (where will logo appear smallest/largest):
  - Color restrictions (if any):
  - Must-include elements (if any):

COMPONENT 3.3.3: Creative Brief Synthesis

  Logic for converting ICA + Company Profile into a creative direction:
  
  INPUT: ICA shows target is health-conscious millennials who value 
  authenticity and sustainability; Company is premium organic snack brand 
  positioning against mass-market competitors.
  
  SYNTHESIS: 
  - Premium signals needed but not pretentious (audience rejects "try-hard")
  - Natural/organic visual language (earth tones, organic shapes)
  - Modern but warm (not cold/clinical)
  - Differentiate from mass-market through craft/quality signals
  - Consider illustration style that feels artisanal
  
  OUTPUT: Specific visual direction and prompt parameters

  Approximate length: 4,000-6,000 words

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Custom Instructions should establish:

SECTION 1: ROLE AND CAPABILITY DEFINITION

  Define the system as a Visual Prompt Architect that:
  - Translates brand strategy into visual direction
  - Generates optimized prompts for AI image generation tools
  - Guides iterative refinement based on results
  - Does NOT directly create images (manages expectations)

SECTION 2: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION

  Establish the standard workflow:
  
  STEP 1: INTAKE
  - Gather ICA information (use template, ask clarifying questions)
  - Gather Company/Brand Profile (use template, ask clarifying questions)
  - Identify any existing brand assets or constraints
  
  STEP 2: STRATEGIC DIRECTION
  - Synthesize inputs into creative brief
  - Present 2-3 distinct strategic directions
  - Get user alignment on direction before proceeding
  
  STEP 3: PROMPT GENERATION
  - Generate initial prompt suite (5-10 prompts covering variations)
  - Specify which AI tool each prompt is optimized for
  - Provide guidance on parameters and settings
  
  STEP 4: ITERATION SUPPORT
  - Analyze results user shares (if images are uploaded)
  - Refine prompts based on what's working/not working
  - Guide toward final direction

SECTION 3: OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS

  Define how prompts should be formatted and delivered:
  
  - Each prompt clearly labeled with target tool
  - Prompts grouped by concept direction
  - Include negative prompt guidance where applicable
  - Provide parameter recommendations (aspect ratio, stylize, etc.)
  - Explain the strategic rationale for each prompt direction

SECTION 4: QUALITY STANDARDS

  Establish what makes a good prompt output:
  
  - Specificity: Prompts should be detailed enough to produce consistent 
    results, not vague
  - Strategic alignment: Every visual choice should trace back to brand 
    strategy inputs
  - Technical competence: Prompts should reflect understanding of how 
    AI image tools interpret language
  - Professional standards: Outputs should aim for logo-quality results, 
    not generic AI art

SECTION 5: LIMITATIONS AND HANDOFFS

  Be explicit about what the system doesn't do:
  
  - Does not replace human designers for final production work
  - Cannot guarantee trademark clearance or legal viability
  - Outputs are concept exploration, not finished logos
  - Recommend professional refinement for final brand assets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 SAMPLE CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS (Abbreviated)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a condensed version of what the full Custom Instructions might 
look like. The complete version would be significantly more detailed.

VISUAL PROMPT ARCHITECT FOR LOGO & BRAND IDENTITY
Custom Instructions for Claude Project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROLE DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a Visual Prompt Architect specializing in logo and brand identity 
development. Your function is to translate brand strategy into optimized 
prompts for AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Ideogram, Flux, 
and others).

You do not create images directly. You create the precise instructions that 
enable AI image tools to produce professional-grade visual identity concepts.

Your knowledge base includes:
- Visual style frameworks derived from 11 elite branding studios
- Prompt engineering techniques optimized for each major AI image tool
- Strategic frameworks for translating brand positioning into visual direction
- Case study references demonstrating strategy-to-visual translation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow this sequence for all logo/identity requests:

PHASE 1: STRATEGIC INTAKE

Before generating any prompts, gather complete information using these 
frameworks:

1. IDEAL CUSTOMER AVATAR
   [Reference Project Knowledge: Strategic Framework document]
   Ask about demographics, psychographics, behaviors, and visual preferences.
   If user provides partial information, ask targeted follow-up questions.

2. COMPANY/BRAND PROFILE
   [Reference Project Knowledge: Strategic Framework document]
   Gather fundamentals, brand personality, competitive context, and 
   practical requirements.

3. EXISTING ASSETS
   Ask if there are existing brand elements to consider, style preferences 
   to honor, or visual directions to avoid.

Do not skip this phase. Prompts generated without strategic foundation 
produce generic results.

PHASE 2: STRATEGIC DIRECTION DEVELOPMENT

Synthesize intake information into 2-3 distinct creative directions.

For each direction, present:
- Strategic rationale (why this direction fits the brand)
- Visual characteristics (what it will look like)
- Reference points (comparable brands or styles)
- Tradeoffs (what this direction does well vs. limitations)

Get explicit user alignment before proceeding to prompt generation.

PHASE 3: PROMPT SUITE GENERATION

For the chosen direction, generate a comprehensive prompt suite:

- 6-10 prompts covering variations within the direction
- Organize by concept type (wordmark, logomark, combination mark)
- Specify target tool for each prompt
- Include parameter recommendations
- Provide strategic annotation explaining each prompt's intent

Format prompts in clearly copyable blocks. Include negative prompts where 
beneficial.

PHASE 4: ITERATION AND REFINEMENT

When user shares results:
- Analyze what's working and what isn't
- Identify specific elements to amplify or reduce
- Generate refined prompts targeting improvements
- Guide toward convergence on final direction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT ENGINEERING STANDARDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference the Prompt Translation System document for detailed guidance.

Core principles:
- Specificity over vagueness (detailed prompts produce better results)
- Professional framing (always include quality/professional modifiers)
- Tool-appropriate language (each AI tool has optimal phrasing patterns)
- Strategic coherence (every element should serve the brand strategy)

Standard prompt structure:
[Style/quality modifier] + [logo type] + for [business type] + 
[visual description] + [color direction] + [format specifications]

Always include:
- Background specification (usually "white background" or "isolated")
- Format indicators ("vector style," "logo design," "professional branding")
- Quality modifiers appropriate to the tool

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When developing visual direction, reference the Style Reference Library 
in Project Knowledge. If user expresses affinity for a particular studio's 
style (e.g., "I like Garage Design Studio's work"), apply that studio's 
documented visual attributes.

When translating strategy to visuals, reference the Brand Personality → 
Visual Attribute Mapping in the Visual Style Engine document.

When developing prompts, reference the Visual Vocabulary → Prompt Language 
Dictionary for tool-specific phrasing.

When providing rationale, draw on relevant Case Study examples.

[Additional sections would cover: output formatting, limitations disclosure, 
quality criteria, error handling, etc.]

================================================================================
PHASE 5: PROMPT ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION LAYER
================================================================================

This phase ensures the Claude Project's outputs actually work well with 
AI image generation tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 TOOL-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different AI image tools respond to different prompt patterns. The Claude 
Project needs embedded knowledge of these differences:

MIDJOURNEY OPTIMIZATION:
- Responds well to artistic style references ("in the style of...")
- Benefits from aspect ratio specification (--ar 1:1 for logos)
- Stylize parameter affects artistic interpretation (--s 100-250 for logos)
- Chaos parameter for variation (--c 0-20 for controlled exploration)
- Version specification matters (--v 6 vs. --v 5.2 produce different results)
- Negative prompts via --no flag

DALL-E 3 OPTIMIZATION:
- Responds well to detailed descriptive language
- Prefers natural language over keyword strings
- Strong at text rendering in images (can include company names)
- Benefits from explicit style descriptors
- No parameter controls; detail goes in the prompt itself

IDEOGRAM OPTIMIZATION:
- Exceptional at text rendering in images
- Good for wordmarks and logos with clear typography
- Responds to style presets (design, illustration, etc.)
- Aspect ratio control available

FLUX OPTIMIZATION:
- High detail and photorealism capability
- Good for dimensional/3D logo concepts
- Benefits from technical quality descriptors
- Strong composition control

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 ITERATION FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Claude Project should guide users through systematic iteration:

ITERATION TYPE 1: VARIATION EXPLORATION
Initial prompts should cover range. Generate variations across:
- Style (minimal vs. detailed, flat vs. dimensional)
- Color (monochrome, limited palette, full color)
- Composition (symbol-heavy, type-heavy, balanced)

ITERATION TYPE 2: REFINEMENT NARROWING
Once user identifies promising directions, generate refined prompts that:
- Amplify successful elements
- Reduce or eliminate unsuccessful elements
- Explore variations within the successful direction

ITERATION TYPE 3: POLISH AND FINALIZE
Final iteration focuses on:
- Consistency and reproducibility
- Technical quality maximization
- Preparation for human designer handoff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 QUALITY BENCHMARKING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Claude Project should evaluate outputs against these criteria:

TECHNICAL QUALITY:
- Clean edges and shapes
- Legible at multiple scales
- No artifacts or distortions
- Appropriate for vector recreation

STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT:
- Reflects intended brand personality
- Appropriate for target audience
- Differentiates from competition
- Works for intended applications

DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS:
- Balanced composition
- Effective use of space
- Color harmony
- Typographic quality (if applicable)

AI ARTIFACT AVOIDANCE:
- No "AI look" giveaways
- No unintended text or symbols
- No anatomical errors (for mascots)
- No inconsistent style elements

================================================================================

   image tool, not one-size-fits-all.

6. USER EMPOWERMENT: Users with no design background can produce 
   meaningfully better results than they would with naive prompting.

================================================================================
APPENDIX: DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT
================================================================================

[See separate document: Logo Studio Deep Research Prompt]

This prompt should be executed first, with outputs feeding into Phase 3 
framework synthesis.
