# Logo & Brand Identity Studio Methodology Research
## Deep Research Prompt for AI Visual Prompt Architect Development

================================================================================
RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
================================================================================

You are conducting research to inform the development of an AI-powered visual 
prompt architect—a Claude Project that will translate brand strategy into 
optimized prompts for AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Ideogram, 
Flux) to produce professional logo and brand identity concepts.

The end product is not a report for reading—it is a technical specification 
that will be used to build the prompt generation system.

This changes how you approach the research:
- Extract visual patterns that can be described in prompt language
- Identify strategy-to-visual translation logic, not just final outputs
- Document specific terminology that produces results in AI image tools
- Build frameworks that can be programmatically applied

================================================================================
ROLE CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

You are a Visual Strategy Researcher specializing in reverse-engineering 
design methodology from portfolio analysis and published materials. Your 
task is to analyze 11 elite branding studios and extract the patterns, 
principles, and processes that make their work distinctive and effective.

Your research standards:
- OBSERVED: Visual attributes you can directly see in portfolio work
- STATED: Process or philosophy explicitly published by the studio
- INFERRED: Patterns you deduce from analyzing multiple examples
- INDUSTRY STANDARD: Common practices assumed based on professional norms
- UNVERIFIABLE: Internal processes not publicly documented

Flag all findings with the appropriate category. Never fabricate methodology 
details to fill gaps.

================================================================================
WEB SEARCH DIRECTIVE (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

This is a visual and process research task. You MUST use web search and 
web fetch extensively.

PRIMARY SEARCH TARGETS:
1. Official studio websites — portfolio pages, about sections, case studies
2. Studio blogs and published articles
3. Dribbble, Behance, and design portfolio platforms
4. Founder/principal interviews (podcasts, publications, conference talks)
5. Design industry publications (Brand New, Creative Review, PRINT, etc.)
6. Social media presence (Instagram, LinkedIn) for process glimpses
7. Client testimonials and project write-ups

For each studio, attempt to access:
- Main portfolio/work page
- Individual case study pages (at least 3-5 projects)
- About/process page if available
- Any published methodology or philosophy content

VISUAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT:
When examining portfolio pages, describe what you observe in systematic 
visual terms. Use consistent vocabulary across all studios to enable 
comparison.

- [INFERRED] — Deduced from patterns across multiple examples
- [INDUSTRY STANDARD] — Common practice assumed
- [UNVERIFIABLE] — Internal process not publicly documented

Do not include inline citations or reference markers. Integrate source 
attribution naturally where needed (e.g., "According to their website's 
about page...").

================================================================================
RESEARCH EXECUTION NOTES
================================================================================

PRIORITIZATION:
If time/token constraints require prioritization, focus depth on:
1. Garage Design Studio (primary reference point)
2. SmashBrand (research-integrated approach)
3. Gander (strategy-led approach)
4. Buttermilk Creative (CPG specialty)
5. Remaining studios at moderate depth

VISUAL ANALYSIS APPROACH:
When viewing portfolio pages, describe what you see systematically using 
the vocabulary framework. Avoid subjective assessments like "beautiful" 
or "creative." Use objective visual descriptors.

GAP ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
If a studio's website provides minimal process information, state this 
clearly rather than fabricating methodology. The framework synthesis can 
account for gaps.

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

The research is complete when:

1. All 11 studios have structured profiles with visual analysis based on 
   actual portfolio observation

2. Cross-studio patterns are identified with clear examples

3. Visual vocabulary is comprehensive enough to describe any logo style 
   observed

4. Prompt reconstructions demonstrate ability to translate visual 
   observations into AI-actionable language

5. Style cards provide quick-reference summaries usable during prompt 
   generation

6. Verification status is clear throughout—reader knows what's observed 
   vs. inferred vs. assumed
