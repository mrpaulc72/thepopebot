# Logo Designer Claude Skill - Project Handoff

**Created:** January 19, 2026  
**Status:** Complete and Ready for Use  
**Location:** `/Users/paul/dev 3/claude-skill-builder/skill-collection/logo-designer/`

## Project Summary

A professional Claude Skill for logo and visual identity design that translates brand strategy into optimized AI image generation prompts. Built using methodologies from 11 elite design studios.

### What It Does
- Captures brand strategy and target audience
- Analyzes brand names for phonetic/visual coherence (optional)
- Develops 2-3 distinct visual concept directions
- Generates tool-specific AI prompts for 6+ image generators
- Provides iteration support for refining outputs

### What It Doesn't Do
- ❌ Brand naming (removed per request - focuses only on visual identity)
- ❌ Legal/trademark advice
- ❌ Direct image generation
- ❌ Production-ready files

---

## File Naming Convention

### The Rule: `kebab-case-everything`

**Simple Rules:**
1. **All lowercase** - no uppercase letters ever
2. **Use hyphens (`-`)** - never spaces or underscores
3. **Alphanumeric only** - no special characters (except hyphens)
4. **No leading numbers** - start with letters, not `1.` or `01-`
5. **Be descriptive** - use full words when possible

**Examples:**

✅ **Good**
```
brand-architect-instructions.md
logo-project-architecture.md
visual-prompt-specification.md
design-studio-research.md
naming-methodology-brief.md
```

❌ **Bad**
```
0. brand_architect_custom_instructions.md  (number prefix, underscores)
1. ChatGPT's Architecture...               (number, apostrophe, spaces)
Design_Studios_Spec.md                     (uppercase, underscores)
Gemini's Logo & Brand Identity...          (apostrophe, ampersand, spaces)
```

**Apply this convention to:**
- ✅ All new files and folders
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Code files
- ✅ Assets (images, etc.)
- ✅ Project directories

## Files Renamed (Cleanup Completed)

All files in `docs/` were renamed from problematic formats to clean `kebab-case`:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| `0. brand_architect_custom_instructions.md` | `brand-architect-instructions.md` |
| `1. ChatGPT's Architecture of Iconic Naming_...` | `naming-methodology-research-brief.md` |
| `4. Claude-logo_project_architecture_011426.md` | `logo-project-architecture.md` |
| `5. Claude-logo_studio_research_prompt_011426.md` | `logo-studio-research-prompt.md` |
| `6. Gemini's Logo & Brand Identity...` | `gemini-logo-studio-methodology-research.md` |
| `7. Perplexity-ai-visual-prompt-architect...` | `visual-prompt-architect-specification.md` |
| `8. Perplexity Design_Studios_Spec.md` | `design-studios-specification.md` |

## Quality Standards

Every output from this skill:
- ✅ Traces back to strategic brief explicitly
- ✅ Uses design studio methodologies appropriately
- ✅ Provides clear strategic rationale
- ✅ Includes tool-specific optimization
- ✅ Offers actionable iteration guidance
- ✅ Uses precise terminology (not vague like "modern" or "clean")

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Based on the comprehensive research in `docs/`, consider adding:

1. **Studio Style Cards** - Quick-reference cards for each of 11 studios
2. **Visual Vocabulary Glossary** - Design term → prompt language dictionary
3. **Category Guidelines** - CPG-specific conventions (coffee, beverages, snacks)
4. **Prompt Template Library** - Pre-built templates for logo types
5. **Case Study Examples** - Real logo analysis from research
6. **Tool Comparison Matrix** - Which AI tool for which logo style

These are documented in the research but not yet formatted as quick-reference materials in the skill.

## Important Notes

### Scope
- **Focuses exclusively on visual identity design** - naming was intentionally removed
- Brand name analysis is optional (Stage 2 is skipped if no name exists)
- Can be used for new brands or visual identity refreshes

### Limitations
- AI outputs are concept exploration, not production files
- Professional design refinement recommended
- Prompts guide but don't guarantee specific outputs

### Research Foundation
Built on extensive research from:
- 11 elite design studio portfolios and methodologies
- AI image generation optimization techniques
- CPG packaging design best practices
- Sound symbolism applied to visual design
- Brand personality → visual attributes mapping
