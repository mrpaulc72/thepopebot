## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply describe what you need:

```
"Create a logo for my coffee company called 'Roast & Rally'"
```

The skill will guide you through gathering strategic inputs and then generate visual concepts with AI prompts.

### Detailed Usage

For best results, provide context upfront:

```
Design a logo for my brand:

Company Name: Veloce Sports
Industry: Athletic Performance Gear
Target Audience: Competitive athletes, ages 25-40
Brand Personality: Fast, innovative, premium
Competitors: Nike, Under Armour (want to differentiate)
Applications: Apparel tags, website, packaging
Preferred Tools: Midjourney and Freepik
```

### Quick Prompts Only

If you have limited time and just need prompts:

```
"Generate Midjourney prompts for a minimal tech startup logo. 
Brand: TechFlow, clean and modern aesthetic."
```

## Four-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Strategic Intake & Brand Profile Synthesis
- Gathers brand name (if exists) and company information
- Captures Ideal Customer Avatar (demographics, psychographics, visual preferences)
- Identifies visual requirements and constraints
- **Output:** Strategic Brief artifact

### Stage 2: Brand Name Analysis & Visual Translation
- Analyzes phonetic and semantic qualities of brand name
- Maps sound characteristics to visual form language
- Identifies visual opportunities and constraints from the name
- **Output:** Visual Translation Brief artifact
- **Note:** Skipped if no brand name exists yet

### Stage 3: Visual Identity Concept Development
- Synthesizes strategic inputs
- References methodologies from 11 elite design studios
- Develops 2-3 genuinely distinct visual concept directions
- Creates comparison matrix
- **User selects preferred direction**

### Stage 4: AI Image Generation Prompt Suite Development
- Clarifies target AI tools (user preference)
- Extracts visual specifications from chosen direction
- Translates design vocabulary into prompt language
- Generates 5-8 primary prompts + 3-5 refinement prompts
- Organizes by exploration stage (Initial → Refinement → Polish)
- **Output:** Complete prompt suite ready for execution

### Supplementary: Iteration & Refinement Support
- Analyzes AI-generated results (when user shares outputs)
- Diagnoses what's working vs. what needs improvement
- Generates refined prompts targeting specific issues
- Available anytime during or after the main workflow

## Design Studio Methodologies

The skill applies visual approaches from 11 elite studios:

| Studio | Visual Signature | Best For |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Garage Design Studio** | Industrial badge, craft aesthetic, textured | Artisanal CPG, coffee, spirits |
| **Buttermilk Creative** | Playful CPG, vibrant colors, mascot-driven | Food & beverage, family products |
| **Gander** | Contemporary DTC, bold color, intentional awkwardness | Millennial/Gen-Z brands |
| **Eye Candy Design** | Bold expressive, tactile finishes, nostalgic-fresh | Beverages, bold consumer products |
| **Evyo Studio** | Minimal cohesive systems, sophisticated simplicity | Premium services, modern tech |
| **SmashBrand** | Performance-optimized, clean hierarchy, shelf-ready | Mass-market CPG, data-driven |
| **Designity** | Systematic branding at scale, Creative Director model | Multiple brands, subscription |
| **Duck.Design** | Trend-aware, consumer behavior integration | Modern consumer brands |
| **Happyland Creative** | Startup-focused efficiency, modernization | Startups, refreshes |
| **Honor Creative** | Story-driven, editorial luxury, narrative-focused | Premium services, heritage |
| **Hardy Brands** | Technical soundness, customer touchpoint mapping | Professional services |

## Key Frameworks

### Brand Personality → Visual Attributes

| Personality | Colors | Typography | Illustration |
|-------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Playful** | Saturated, varied | Rounded, bouncy | Character-driven |
| **Premium** | Restrained, sophisticated | Refined serif/elegant sans | Minimal/photography |
| **Trustworthy** | Blues, neutrals | Clean sans-serif | Simple iconography |
| **Innovative** | Unexpected combinations | Modern geometric | Abstract, dynamic |
| **Authentic/Craft** | Earth tones, muted | Hand-lettered | Textured, detailed |
| **Warm/Approachable** | Warm palette, organic | Humanist sans | Soft shapes, characters |

### Phonetic-to-Visual Translation

When a brand name exists, the skill maps sound qualities to visual form:

| Sound Quality | Visual Form | Prompt Language |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fricatives (F, S, Z) | Flowing, continuous | "smooth curves", "flowing lines" |
| Plosives (P, T, K) | Sharp, defined | "bold geometry", "crisp edges" |
| Open vowels (A, O) | Spacious | "open composition", "breathing room" |
| Front vowels (E, I) | Bright, forward | "bright colors", "dynamic angles" |
| Nasals (M, N) | Connected, warm | "organic shapes", "connected elements" |

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Provide Strategic Context
Don't just ask for "a logo" - explain the brand personality, target audience, and competitive landscape.

### 2. Specify Your AI Tools
Different tools have different strengths. Let the skill know which tools you'll use so it can optimize prompts accordingly.

### 3. Be Honest About Constraints
Mention must-have elements, colors to avoid, application requirements (e.g., "must work at app icon size").

### 4. Share Results for Iteration
When you generate images, share them (or describe them) so the skill can refine prompts targeting specific improvements.

### 5. Choose a Direction Before Prompts
Don't skip to Stage 4 - the visual concept directions in Stage 3 ensure strategic alignment before generating lots of prompts.

## Limitations & Boundaries

### What This Skill Does NOT Do:
- ❌ Brand naming and linguistic strategy (separate skill needed)
- ❌ Legal advice on trademarks or copyrights
- ❌ Direct image generation (produces prompts, not images)
- ❌ Production-ready logo files (AI outputs need professional refinement)
- ❌ Complete brand guideline creation (focuses on logo/identity concepts)
- ❌ Website development or full marketing campaigns

### Important Disclaimers:
- AI image outputs are **concept exploration**, not finished logos
- Professional design refinement is recommended for final brand assets
- AI tools have inherent variability - prompts guide but don't guarantee specific outputs
- Sound symbolism and design psychology are statistical tendencies, not certainties

## Quality Standards

Every output:
- ✅ Traces back to strategic brief explicitly
- ✅ Uses design studio methodologies appropriately
- ✅ Provides clear strategic rationale
- ✅ Includes tool-specific optimization
- ✅ Offers actionable iteration guidance
- ✅ Uses precise design terminology (not vague terms like "modern" or "clean")

## Version

Based on comprehensive design studio research and AI prompt optimization methodologies as of January 2026.

## License

Use freely for personal or commercial projects. Adapt as needed for your specific workflows.

## Recommendations for Enhancement

Based on the comprehensive research in the `docs/` folder, consider these additions:

1. **Add More Studio Profiles:** The research includes detailed analysis of all 11 studios - these could be formatted as quick-reference cards in the knowledge base

2. **Visual Vocabulary Glossary:** Create a standalone reference of design terminology → prompt language translations

3. **Category-Specific Guidelines:** Add CPG category conventions (beverages, snacks, beauty, etc.) from the research

4. **Prompt Template Library:** Pre-built templates for common logo types (wordmark, logomark, combination mark, emblem)

5. **Case Study Examples:** Include the analyzed logo projects from the research as learning examples

6. **Tool Comparison Matrix:** Quick reference showing which AI tool is best for different logo types and styles

These enhancements would make the skill even more powerful but aren't required for core functionality.
